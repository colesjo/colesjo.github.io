# Summary 

> To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.
>
> > Leonard Bernstein

This quote is the ethos that I have used throughout my academic and professional career. Throughout the many difficulties that I have faced during this time I have found that a well organised and efficient plan working in tandem with a determined effort from myself and the team I'm working with precipitates the best possible outcomes for all parties involved. Also, as my educational and extracurricular activities should suggest, I have a passion for geography, sustainability, and current affairs, and I am willing to put in a great amount of effort to build my understanding regarding these fields. Whilst it may be noted that my experience in the professional world of work is limited, I hope you can see that my passion, determination, and ability to cooperate proves to you that I am the best candidate for the position that you are offering. :smile: :thumbsup: :wrench:
